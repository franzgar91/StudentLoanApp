# StudentLoanApp

One of the Projects done for Object Oriented Programming With Java.

Prototype GUI student loan calculator app to let students see how modifying their repayment schedules 
would affect the loan cost in terms of the amount of interest that the student would pay.

NOTE: the  Ontario Student Assistance Program was being modified at the time this was coded (March 2020), so actual repayment rules were in a state of flux. 
This app follows fictional repayment rules created for this project only:

- The CSL uses an interest rate of prime plus 2.5%
- The OSL uses an interest rate of prime plus 1.0%
